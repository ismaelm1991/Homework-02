# Homework-08

This is a project that actively shows some of the skills I have obtained while studying in the coding bootcamp program.


Inside you will have some information in regards to my background and some links to my social media.

Please keep in mind this is a work in progress and will be finished throughout the course.

A lot of the changes I made throughout the course of this homework are reflected in the different tools in Bootstrap I was using.

The placeholder images of kittens you see, are a result of me not being able to download images of myself from the internet.

This is an active relfection of the things I have learned in regards to different CSS styles in regards to containers and semantic HTML.

In the links you will find my Instagram, and my LinkedIn profile(s).

UPDATE 9/29/2020:

I have made some updates and modifications to this file, you will now find the working email link to contact me directly. 

You will also find I have added and implemented my LinkedIn profile is now accessible from the page as a link that opens a new tab.

I have implemented and provided a resume which actively reflects my newfound skills and projects of note.

I have also made some subtle changes to the overall code to enhance the viewing experience from when you load the page!
